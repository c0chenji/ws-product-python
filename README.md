[What is this for?](https://github.com/EQWorks/work-samples#what-is-this)

### Setup and Run

The following are the recommended options, but you're free to use any means to get started.

#### Remote Option: Glitch.com

1. [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/EQWorks/ws-product-python)
2. Populate `.env` file with the environment variables given in the problem set we send to you through email
3. Click on `Show Live` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

#### Local Option 1: Python 3.6+

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python level dependencies. `$ pipenv install` or `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `$ pipenv run SQL_URI=<SQL connection URI> ./start.sh` where `SQL_URI` value should be given in the problem set we send to you through email
4. Open your browser and point to `localhost:5000` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

#### Local Option 2: Docker (`docker-compose` needed)

1. Clone this repository
2. Create and populate `.env` file with the environment variables given in the problem set we send to you through email
3. `$ docker-compose up` (or `$ docker-compose up -d` to run as a daemon)
4. Open your browser and point to `localhost:5000` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

### Notes on working through the problems

Make sure any additional Python level dependencies are properly added in `Pipfile`. We encourage a healthy mixture of your own implementations, and good choices of existing open-source libraries/tools. We will comment in the problems to indicate which ones cannot be solved purely through an off-the-shelf solution.
